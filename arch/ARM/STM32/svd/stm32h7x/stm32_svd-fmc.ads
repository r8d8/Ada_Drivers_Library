      SDCMR : aliased SDCMR_Register;
      --  This register sets the refresh rate in number of SDCLK clock cycles

      --  must be increased by 20 SDRAM clock cycles (as in the above example)
      --  to obtain a safe margin if an internal refresh request occurs when a
      --  read request has been accepted. It corresponds to a COUNT value of
      --  0000111000000 (448). This 13-bit field is loaded into a timer which
      --  is decremented using the SDRAM clock. This timer generates a refresh
      --  pulse when zero is reached. The COUNT value must be set at least to
      --  41 SDRAM clock cycles.As soon as the FMC_SDRTR register is
      --  programmed, the timer starts counting. If the value programmed in the
      --  register is 0, no refresh is carried out. This register must not be
      --  reprogrammed after the initialization procedure to avoid modifying
      --  the refresh rate.Each time a refresh pulse is generated, this 13-bit
      --  COUNT field is reloaded into the counter.If a memory access is in
      --  progress, the Auto-refresh request is delayed. However, if the memory
      --  access and Auto-refresh requests are generated simultaneously, the
      --  Auto-refresh takes precedence. If the memory access occurs during a
      --  refresh operation, the request is buffered to be processed when the
      --  refresh is complete.This register is common to SDRAM bank 1 and bank
      --  2.
